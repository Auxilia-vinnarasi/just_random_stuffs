registration page:-name,email,password needs to be done...
after registration i am getting the user created successfully...
it will directly navigated to the login page.
negative scenarios also needs to be taken care.if i enter same emailid - it has to throw the error.
invalid login means - this email id doesnot exist in our database..incorrect password means- it will be throwing incorrect password message..
valid mailid,valid password means-click login button: it will navigate to the bus ticket booking application..
sidebar,header,  and body in body ie below header:the page will be rendered..
in authentication:im gonna have two roles 1.normal user, 2.admin..the loggedin user is :normal user.
in home page: Home,Bookings,profile,logout.:filter the buses using from place to place - as well as journey date
home page:select the bus,filter the bus.. bus name:from to journey date, fare and book now
then it will navigated to the book now page.
1>virtual bus has to be created..bus details from and to journey date, seat capacity,..we can select the bus seats.. also..and fare get added accoding to the seats booked.
using stripe payment gateway..it will hit the payment api..once its suucessful..pay..payment successful,and the bus is booked successfully .we will be having the details in booking.
Bookings:
bus name,bus number,journey date,journey time,seats,action-print ticket:click print:pdf
if i logged in with the admin:the role is changed and the side bar menu has :home, buses,users,bookings,logout, also changed..
in user bookings: - will get only the specific user. in admin bookings: we will get all the bookings thats all..
buses:(any new service on particular day) - Add bus and name of the bus,number,from to,journey date,status,action..
add bus:... new bus service :bus name,number,capacity,from,to,journeydate,departuretime,arrival time,type :Ac-non ac,fare-amount,status -yet to start..save :bus added successfully:
edit the details, that is crud..we can not able to add the same number with same bus name: it will shown bus is already exists.
so lets assume the bus has done its journey and the tickets are also sold successfully..now we have to update the status to completed means..it wont be visible to the homepage.
so in display :its shown only yet to start buses...
